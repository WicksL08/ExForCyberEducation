# Ex4CSLearning 
Explore, learn, and test your cyber security skills through fun, hands-on challenges!
This website is part of a research study led by The University of Alabama to understand how interactive activities like Capture the Flag (CTF) can help high school students learn cyber security concepts in engaging and practical ways.

Here, you’ll find:

- Learning modules that introduce key cyber security topics such as OSINT, Cryptography and Password Cracking.

- CTF challenges that let you apply what you’ve learned by solving real-world problems.

- Videos and guides to help you explore cyber security tools and techniques safely and responsibly.

- Pre- and post-tests to track your growth and understanding throughout the study.

By participating, you’re contributing to research that aims to improve cyber security education across Alabama and beyond. Your participation helps us design better learning experiences for future students interested in technology, problem-solving, and protecting digital spaces.

Get ready to think like a cyber security analyst, follow the clues and see how learning through experience can make cyber security come alive!
