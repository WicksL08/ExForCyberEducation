# Consent & Assent Forms 

Before participating in the **Ex4CSLearning** study, all participants must complete the appropriate electronic consent form(s).  
These DocuSign forms ensure that participation is voluntary, that data are handled ethically, and that all parties understand their rights and responsibilities.

##  Parent/Guardian Consent & Student Assent

Parents/guardians and students must review and sign this combined form **before the study begins**.  
The document explains the study’s purpose, what students will be doing during the Capture the Flag (CTF) activities, and how privacy will be protected.
