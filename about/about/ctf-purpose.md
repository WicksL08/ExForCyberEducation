# The Purpose of Capture The Flag (CTF) 🎯

**Capture The Flag (CTF)** events are interactive learning games where participants solve cybersecurity challenges to “capture flags” —
hidden clues that represent successful completion of a task.  

At **Ex4CSLearning**, CTFs are not about competition — they are about **curiosity, creativity, and confidence-building** through exploration and teamwork.

## 🧩 Why Use CTFs for Learning?

CTFs turn theory into practice. Instead of just reading about cybersecurity concepts, students *apply* them to real scenarios.

| Traditional Learning | CTF-Based Learning |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Lecture-driven | Hands-on, problem-driven |
| Passive understanding | Active experimentation |
| Limited engagement | Gamified participation |
| Isolated skills | Integrated technical + ethical thinking |

## 🧠 What Students Learn

CTF challenges in this study focus on:
- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)** — research and verification.  
- **Cryptography** — encoding, encryption, and hashing.  
- **Password Security** — hashing, salting, and strong password creation.  

Each challenge builds skills in:
- Critical thinking  
- Digital ethics  
- Collaboration  
- Cyber awareness

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

The **purpose of this CTF-based model** is to:
1. Make cyber security approachable for high school students.  
2. Support teachers with lesson-ready, standards-aligned content.  
3. Strengthen understanding through **experiential learning**.  
4. Foster interest in cyber security and related careers.  

> *When students play, explore, and think like analysts — they learn more deeply.*

##  How It Works

Students complete challenges hosted on the **CTFd platform**, where each flag represents a learning milestone.  
The researcher provides lesson materials, reflection prompts, and pre/post assessments to measure growth.
