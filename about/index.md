# About the Study 

**Ex4CSLearning** evaluates a Capture-the-Flag (CTF)-based experiential model for high-school cyber security education across Alabama.

This project is part of a doctoral research study at **The University of Alabama**, exploring how experiential learning can increase engagement and understanding in cyber security education across Alabama’s high schools.

## Mission & Goals

Our mission is to make cyber security education **fun, accessible, and meaningful** by connecting real-world cyber skills to **Alabama’s K–12 Computer Science Standards**.

The goals of Ex4CSLearning are to:

- Encourage critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving through real challenges.  
- Support teachers with **ready-to-use CTF activities**, lesson guides, and standards mappings.  
- Inspire students to explore **cyber security careers** through experiential learning.  
- Bridge the gap between classroom theory and hands-on technical skills.
