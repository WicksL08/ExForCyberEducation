 Ethics in Cybersecurity Learning ⚖️

At **Ex4CSLearning**, we believe that learning cyber security requires not only technical skills but also a strong sense of **ethics, integrity, and responsibility**.  

This study emphasizes that *ethical cyber security practice protects people, data, and systems* — and that students should always use their knowledge for positive and lawful purposes.

## What Does “Ethical” Mean?

Ethics in cyber security is about **doing the right thing even when no one is watching**.  
Students are encouraged to:
- Use their skills to **protect** systems, not exploit them.  
- **Respect privacy** — never access or share someone’s information without permission.  
- **Ask permission** before testing or scanning a system.  
- **Report vulnerabilities responsibly** (to a teacher or administrator).  
- Use cybersecurity challenges to **learn**, not to break rules.

##  What’s Not Allowed

To protect all participants and uphold research ethics:
- No unauthorized hacking or system testing.  
- No data scraping or collection of personal information.  
- No sharing or publishing of challenge answers.  
- No AI-assisted cheating or plagiarism in responses.  

All activities in this project occur in **controlled, simulated CTF environments** where students can safely practice without affecting real systems.

## Ethical Research Standards

This study has been approved by **The University of Alabama Institutional Review Board (IRB)**.  
All data is collected **anonymously** and used only for educational improvement and research analysis.  

Participants are reminded:
- You may stop participating at any time.  
- No identifying information is recorded.  
- Teachers act only as facilitators — not evaluators.  
- All results are shared in **aggregate form** to protect privacy.  

>  *Our goal: to create responsible, informed, and ethical cyber security citizens.*
