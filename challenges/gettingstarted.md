# Getting Started with Ex4CSLearning 

Welcome to the **Ex4CSLearning Capture-the-Flag (CTF)** platform!  
Before completing challenges, you’ll need to create a secure account on the **CTFd site**.  

Please follow the steps below carefully. Your username format helps us organize student participation by school without using personal names.

---

##  Step 1 — Go to the CTFd Website

Visit:  
 **[https://ex4cslearning.ctfd.io](https://ex4cslearning.ctfd.io)**

You’ll see a page that says *“Welcome to Ex4CSLearning”* with a sign-up option.

---

## Step 2 — Click “Sign Up”

- On the top right, click **Sign Up**.  
- Enter your **email address** (school or temporary email).  
- Create a **secure password** you can remember.  
- Re-enter the password to confirm.  

>  *Use your school email if possible. Do not use your personal or family email.*

---

##  Step 3 — Create Your Username

To help the research team identify participation by school **without using student names**,  
you must use this naming format:
SCHOOLNAME-STUDENT-INITIALSLASTANDFIRSTS

### Example:
| School | Student Name | Correct Username |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| TuscaloosaAcademy | Jordan Smith | `TUSCALOOSAA-STUDENT-SMJ` |
| GulfShoresHigh | Asha Brown | `GULFSHORESH-STUDENT-BA` |
| MadisonCTC | Dylan Nguyen | `MADISONCTC-STUDENT-ND` |

> *This format keeps students anonymous while allowing teachers to sort submissions by school.*

---

## Step 4 — Join the Correct Team (if applicable)

If your teacher provides a **team code** or **school group**,  
enter that code during registration or from the **Teams** tab after signing up.

If not, you can proceed as an individual student. Your username already includes your school identifier.

---

## Step 5 — Verify and Log In

After creating your account:
1. Check your email (including spam folder) for the **confirmation message**.  
2. Click the verification link.  
3. Log in and start exploring your challenges!

---

## Important Rules

- **Do not share flags or answers** with other students.  
- **Do not change your username** after sign up.  
- If you forget your password, use the **“Forgot Password”** option on the login screen.  
- **Ask your teacher** before making any profile changes.  

> *Remember: your CTFd username should only identify your school and initials. Never use your full name.*
