This short module introduces cyber security concepts through **Capture-the-Flag (CTF)** activities (OSINT, Cryptography, Passwords). Activities are teacher-facilitated and student-centered, mapped to Alabama K-12 and NICE standards.

## 2. Learning Outcomes
Students will be able to:
- Explain differences among **encoding, hashing, and encryption**.  
- Apply **search/verification** strategies for OSINT.  
- Describe **password best practices** and the role of **salts** and **hashes**.  
- Reflect on ethical use of open-source information and **digital citizenship**.

## 3. Study Schedule 
| Day | Topics & Activities | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **OSINT Warm-Up** challenge | Screenshot log + reflection |
| 2 | **Crypto Warm-Up** (Base64 + substitution) | Decoded message + quick check |
| 3 | **Password Intro** (hashes & salts) | Compare hashes worksheet |

## 4. Materials & Tech
- Chromebook/MacBook or lab PCs with internet  
- Access to site: `{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/`  
- (Optional) CTFd links provided by instructor  

## 5. Classroom Norms & Safety
- Use only **legal** and **public** sources; no bypassing security.  
- Follow school AUP & teacher directions.
