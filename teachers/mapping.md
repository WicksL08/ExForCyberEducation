# Standards Mapping 

The **Ex4CSLearning 3-Day Pilot** aligns each Capture-the-Flag (CTF) topic to the  
**Alabama K-12 Computer Science Standards (2021)** and the **NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (2020)**.  

These mappings ensure classroom activities meet both **state academic goals** and **national cybersecurity competencies**.

You can drop this whole block into your **mapping page** and:

- Adjust **points/levels** if they’re different in CTFd.  
- If you decide on *official* DLCS code labels later (e.g., “DLCS 9–12 CS.3”), you can just replace the “R1, R2…” text in the DLCS column.  
- If you add new challenges, just copy a row, change the title, and adjust the standards.

If you tell me which file name you’re using for the mapping page (`mapping.md`, `teachers-mapping.md`, etc.), I can rewrite this snippet with your exact headings/intro text so it drops in perfectly.
