# Standards Mapping 🧭

The **Ex4CSLearning 3-Day Pilot** aligns each Capture-the-Flag (CTF) topic to the  
**Alabama K-12 Computer Science Standards (2021)** and the **NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (2020)**.  

These mappings ensure classroom activities meet both **state academic goals** and **national cybersecurity competencies**.

## 🕵️‍♀️ Day 1 — OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) & Digital Ethics

| Focus Area | Description | Alabama K-12 Standard (2021) | NICE Framework Element |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Information Literacy** | Students use search operators and open data sources to locate information ethically. | 3A-IC-25 — Evaluate accuracy, relevance, and bias of digital resources. | **K0016** Knowledge of OSINT tools and data sources |
| **Ethical Research & Verification** | Distinguish credible information from misinformation. | 2A-IC-20 — Describe responsible and ethical use of technology. | **S0036** Skill in information verification |
| **Digital Citizenship** | Respect privacy, ownership, and integrity of online content. | 3A-IC-28 — Collaborate responsibly to produce and share digital artifacts. | **K0008** Knowledge of cyber ethics |

> 💡 **Connection to Activity:** OSINT challenges (“World’s Traveler,” “Find the Bean,” “The Vanished Motto”) emphasize research, verification, and ethics in digital exploration.

## 🔑 Day 3 — Password Security & Ethical Reflection

| Focus Area | Description | Alabama K-12 Standard (2021) | NICE Framework Element |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Password Strength & Entropy** | Evaluate password length, complexity, and strength. | 3A-CS-03 — Identify and apply security practices to protect digital data. | **K0057** Knowledge of authentication and access control |
| **Hashing & Salting** | Explain one-way functions and how salts protect stored passwords. | 3A-CS-01 — Recommend security measures to mitigate vulnerabilities. | **K0038** Knowledge of hashing algorithms |
| **Ethical Hacking Awareness** | Discuss responsible password testing and legal boundaries. | 3A-IC-22 — Debate laws and regulations related to cybersecurity. | **K0008** Knowledge of cyber ethics and responsible use |
| **Reflection & Feedback** | Reflect on learning outcomes and ethical decision-making. | 3A-IC-24 — Communicate importance of ethics and security. | **S0058** Skill in documenting and reporting findings |

> 💡 **Connection to Activity:** Password challenges (“How Long Until It’s Gone,” “County Salt,” “Forgotten Coffee Shop Vibes”) build digital-security awareness through guided experimentation.
