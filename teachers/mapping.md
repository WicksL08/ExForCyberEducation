# Standards Mapping for Teachers

This page maps each classroom challenge to target **concepts**, suggested **Alabama K-12 CS** standards, and relevant **NICE** competencies. Use it to plan pacing, introduce vocabulary, and align quick checks for understanding.


---

## How to Read This
- **Concept** – the core idea students practice.
- **Activity** – the specific Ex4CSLearning task or checkpoint.
- **AL K-12 CS** – suggested Alabama Computer Science standard(s) to tag in your lesson plan.  
  *(Replace codes to match your district’s adoption; placeholders provided.)*
- **NICE** – related NICE KSAs/Tasks (high-level alignment).
